Ideas for improving the total result
====================================
* Find one or several reasonable initial approximations of a solution
	- Find extrema between zeros and interpolate between them for an inital approximation
	- Possibly it makes sense to interpolate the zeros as well
	- Erase zeros, if they are located to close to each other
	- Make sure that boundary conditions are fulfilled automatically (erasing zeros might actually help here)
	
* Use a different base for the functions to get better locality characteristics
	- Try a wavelet base. 
	- For the imaginary part use a base of monotonic functions satisfying the boundary conditions
	
* Combine the boundary conditions $|\tau_i-\tau_{i+1}| \le \min\{ (\Im\tau_j)^2,(\Im\tau_{j+1})^2 \}$ and $0 \le \Im\tau_j$ into one: 
	$$ |\tau_i-\tau_{i+1}| \le \max\{ 0, \min\{ \Im\tau_j,\Im\tau_{j+1} \} \}^2 $$
	
* Allow phase-boost under certain circumstances
	- If there is a big enough decreasing jump of the phase then a phase boost may be applied.


Things to do on the gui
=======================
* Let the user choose the noise level to be added to the initial approximation
* Let the user choose the parameters of the target function
